# Solar-tracking
Software for tracking sun on dual axis
This is v2. of my software for tracking possition of the sun for solar panels. It was made with Arduino UNO and .net app.
Arduino was used to control electronics and it was made to send data to the app on pc. Program is not fully finished it is able to track sun on one axis 
but not on dual.

Needs to be done

-Adjust the possition better and replace stepper motor with servo motor for better control 
-Finish the code for user half-automaitc control of motors
-Remake the UI (only the skeleton is done)

The code contains PDF file which in great detail explains the software 
NOTE The file was written in Bosnian.

It shows how the connections are made ( this part was in a diagram so everyone can understand it)
how the cooling for the electronics work ( since i made it with thought of it working in diffrent and harsh enviorments it is made in thick plastic chasis )
